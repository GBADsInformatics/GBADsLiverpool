# Calculating head placed

For poultry, head placed is calculated as chicks placed adjusted for net imports.

Eurostat reports chicks <i>hatched</i>. For countries using this source, head placed is calculated as chicks hatched plus net import of chicks plus net import of adults.

All other sources report chicks <i>placed</i>. For countries using these sources, we assume import/export of chicks is already accounted for, so head placed is calculated as chicks placed plus net import of adults.
