```

<h3>Poultry</h3>
<b>Days on feed</b><br />
The average growout time in days from placement of chicks to slaughter. This is used to determine the breed standard potential in the production chart by looking up the average live weight and carcass yield from the breed standard table.

<b>Achievable % of breed standard</b><br />
The percent of the breed standard growth that is achievable based on regional factors that are not due to disease. Setting the slider to 100% means that producers in the selected country should be able to match the breed standard growth. A setting less than 100% means that even without disease, producers would not be able to meet breed standard growth due to poor quality feed, housing, climate or other factors. A setting more than 100% means that producers should be able to exceed the breed standard.

<b>Producer price</b><br />
The price producers receive in US dollars per kg carcass weight. Also called the farm-gate price.

<b>Feed price</b><br />
The price of compound feed in US dollars per tonne.

<b>Ideal feed conversion ratio</b><br />
The expected feed conversion ratio if there were no disease burden.

<h3>Swine</h3>
<b>Days on feed</b><br />
The average growout time in days from weaning to slaughter. This is used to determine the breed standard potential in the production chart by looking up the average live weight and carcass yield from the breed standard table.

<b>Achievable live weight without disease</b><br />
The live weight for an individual animal that is achievable if there were no disease burden.

<b>Producer price</b><br />
The price producers receive in US dollars per kg carcass weight. Also called the farm-gate price.

<b>Feed price</b><br />
The price of compound feed in US dollars per tonne.

<b>Ideal feed conversion ratio</b><br />
The expected feed conversion ratio if there were no disease burden.
