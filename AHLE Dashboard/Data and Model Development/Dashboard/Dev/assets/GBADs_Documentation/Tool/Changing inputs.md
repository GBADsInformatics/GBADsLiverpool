# Changing inputs
<p>
The second row of controls contains sliders for changing values used in the burden of disease calculations. Reference values beneath the sliders show data for the selected country and year, if available, and define the default for each slider. Click the <i>Reset to default</i> button on the right to reset all sliders to their default value.

Changing inputs and assumptions
```

<h3>Poultry</h3>
	<p><b>Days on feed</b><br />
	The average growout time in days from placement of chicks to slaughter. This is used to determine the breed standard potential weight by looking up the average live weight and carcass yield from the breed standard table.
	</p>
	<p><b>Achievable % of breed standard</b><br />
	The percent of the breed standard growth that is achievable based on regional factors that are not due to disease. Default value is 100%. Setting the slider to 100% means that producers in the selected country should be able to match the breed standard growth. A setting less than 100% means that even without disease, producers would not be able to meet breed standard growth due to poor quality feed, housing, climate or other non-disease factors. A setting more than 100% means that producers should be able to exceed the breed standard.
	</p>
	<p><b>Producer price</b><br />
	The price producers receive in US dollars per kg carcass weight.
	</p>
	<p><b>Feed price</b><br />
	The price of compound feed in US dollars per tonne.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal feed conversion ratio</b><br />
	The expected feed conversion ratio if there were no disease burden, expressed as kg of feed per kg of live weight.
	</p>
<h3>Swine</h3>
	<p><b>Days on feed</b><br />
	The average growout time in days from weaning to slaughter. This is used to determine the breed standard potential weight by looking up the average live weight and carcass yield from the breed standard table.
	</p>
	<p><b>Achievable live weight without disease</b><br />
	The live weight for an individual animal that is achievable if there were no disease burden. Default value is 10% higher than the actual average live weight for the selected country and year.
	</p>
	<p><b>Producer price</b><br />
	The price producers receive in US dollars per kg carcass weight.
	</p>
	<p><b>Feed price</b><br />
	The price of compound feed in US dollars per tonne.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal feed conversion ratio</b><br />
	The expected feed conversion ratio if there were no disease burden, expressed as kg of feed per kg of live weight.
