# Value and cost chart
<p>
The value and cost chart shows the major components of value and cost under current conditions and compares them to an ideal scenario for the selected species, production system, and year. Blue bars indicate a positive monetary value and red bars indicate a negative value (cost). The orange bar is the gross margin, calculated as the sum of all values minus costs. The value components displayed depend on the selected species because some, such as milk and hides, are not produced for all species.

The controls for the value and cost chart are:

<p><b>Display</b><br />
This sets the value and cost chart to display either side-by-side bars for the current and ideal scenarios or the difference between them.

<p><b>Compare current scenario to</b><br />
This selects the scenario to compare to. Scenarios are:
<ul>
	<li>Ideal: reflecting an ideal scenario with zero mortality and improved fertility and live weight.</li>
	<li>Zero Mortality: reflecting a scenario with zero mortality but fertility and live weight equal to current values.</li>
	<li>Improvement: allows a selection of other scenarios with partial improvement to mortality, fertility, or live weight.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Improvement Factor</b><br />
If <i>Improvement</i> is selected, use this dropdown to select a factor to define a partial-improvement scenario.
<ul>
	<li>Mortality</li>
	<li>Live Weight </li>
	<li>Parturition Rate</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Scenario applies to group</b><br />
Allows the user to view the impact on values and costs if the improvement scenario is applied to different age/sex groups.
