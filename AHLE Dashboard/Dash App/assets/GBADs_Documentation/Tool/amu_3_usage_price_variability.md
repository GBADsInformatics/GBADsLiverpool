<h3>Reported Usage and Estimates</h3>
<p>
Antimicrobial usage estimates are produced for terrestrial livestock as follows:
</p>
<p><b>A:</b><br />
Limited to countries reporting total antimicrobial usage to WOAH. Estimate for terrestrial livestock based on terrestrial biomass as a proportion of total biomass. Extended to 2020 by assuming the trend from 2016-2018 continues.
</p>
<p><b>B:</b><br />
Estimate A extrapolated to whole region based on the proportion of terrestrial biomass for the region represented in the countries reporting.
</p>
<p><b>C:</b><br />
Whole-region estimate for terrestrial livestock from Mulchandani et. al. (https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001305).
</p>
