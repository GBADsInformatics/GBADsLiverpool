<p>
This section displays the antimicrobial usage data reported to WOAH in 2 charts: a bar chart displaying regional usage of each antimicrobial class or group and a donut chart displaying the proportion of global usage each class makes up.

Antimicrobial usage by region and class
```
<p>
Use the controls along the top of the page to change how you view the data.
</p>

<p><b>Regional AMU Bar Display</b><br />
Modifies the bar chart. Select <i>Total</i> to display usage totals for each antimicrobial group within each region. Select <i>Percent</i> to display the percent of the region's total attributed to each antimicrobial group (a 100% stacked bar).
</p>

<p><b>AMU Units</b><br />
Modifies the bar chart and the donut chart. Select <i>Tonnes</i> to display usage in tonnes of each antimicrobial group. Select <i>mg per kg biomass</i> to display usage in mg per kg biomass, defined for each antimicrobial group and region as (tonnes of antimicrobial) x 1e9 / (kg total biomass for countries reporting in the region).
</p>

<p><b>Antimicrobial Grouping</b><br />
Determines how antimicrobials are grouped in both the bar chart and donut chart. Options are:
<br /><br />
<i>Top Global Classes:</i> Shows the 3 antimicrobial classes with the highest global usage with all other classes grouped into "Others".
<br /><br />
<i>WHO Importance Categories:</i> Groups antimicrobial classes according to the <a href='https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/312266/9789241515528-eng.pdf'>World Health Organization's definitions</a> of importance for human health.
<br /><br />
<i>WOAH Importance Categories:</i> Groups antimicrobial classes according to the <a href='https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/06/a-oie-list-antimicrobials-june2021.pdf'>World Organization for Animal Health definitions</a> of importance.
<br /><br />
<i>OneHealth Importance Categories:</i> Groups antimicrobial classes according to the <a href='https://ssrn.com/abstract=4346767'>Venkateswaran et al., 2023 definitions</a> of importance.
<br /><br />
<i>Individual Classes:</i> Shows all antimicrobial classes individually. Very small classes making up less than 2% of global usage are grouped into "Other", or "Other (Important)" if they are classified as important by the OneHealth importance categorization.
</p>

<p><b>Region</b><br />
Modifies the donut chart. Select <i>All</i> to show the proportion of global usage accounted for by each antimicrobial group. Select a region to show the proportion of usage of each antimicrobial group just within that region.
