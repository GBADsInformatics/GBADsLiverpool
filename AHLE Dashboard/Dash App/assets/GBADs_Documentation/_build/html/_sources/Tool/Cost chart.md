# Cost chart
<p>
The cost chart shows side-by-side bars comparing the actual costs of production to the ideal costs if there were no disease burden. The cost categories shown depend on the data available for each species.

<h3>Poultry</h3>
	<p>
	Costs for poultry are reported per kg live weight. Actual costs come directly from the sources identified in the main data table. Ideal costs are calculated as below.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Feed Cost</b><br />
	Ideal feed consumption multiplied by the price determined by the <i>Feed price</i> slider. Ideal feed consumption is the feed required to match the realised production at the ideal FCR set by the <i>Ideal feed conversion ratio</i> slider, assuming carcass yield is equal to the breed standard.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Chick Cost</b><br />
	Equal to actual chick cost reduced in proportion to head placed, defined by (ideal head placed) / (actual head placed). Ideal head placed is the number of head needed to match the realised production if all head survived and achieved the breed standard potential weight.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Land & Housing Cost</b><br />
	Equal to actual land & housing cost reduced in proportion to head placed, defined by (ideal head placed) / (actual head placed).
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Labour Cost</b><br />
	Equal to actual labour cost reduced in proportion to land & housing cost, defined by (ideal land & housing cost) / (actual land & housing cost). Note we are using the reduction in land & housing cost as a proxy for the reduction in land & housing requirements.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Other Cost</b><br />
	Equal to actual other cost reduced in proportion to head placed, defined by (ideal head placed) / (actual head placed).
	</p>
	<p><b>Burden of Disease</b><br />
	The difference between total actual costs and total ideal costs.
	</p>
<h3>Swine</h3>
	<p>
	Costs for swine are reported per kg carcass weight. Cost categories are those reported by the InterPIG association. Actual costs come directly from InterPIG. Ideal costs are calculated as below.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Feed Cost</b><br />
	Ideal feed consumption multiplied by the price determined by the <i>Feed price</i> slider. Ideal feed consumption is the feed required to match the realised production at the ideal FCR set by the <i>Ideal feed conversion ratio</i> slider, assuming carcass yield is equal to the breed standard.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Nonfeed Variable Costs</b><br />
	Equal to actual nonfeed variable cost reduced in proportion to head placed, defined by (ideal head placed) / (actual head placed). Ideal head placed is the number of head needed to match the realised production if all head survived and achieved the breed standard potential weight.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Labour Cost</b><br />
	Equal to actual labour cost reduced in proportion to finance cost, defined by (ideal land & housing cost) / (actual land & housing cost). Note we are using the reduction in finance cost as a proxy for the reduction in land & housing requirements.
	</p>
	<p><b>Ideal Finance Cost</b><br />
	Equal to actual finance cost reduced in proportion to head placed, defined by (ideal head placed) / (actual head placed).
	</p>
	<p><b>Burden of Disease</b><br />
	The difference between total actual costs and total ideal costs.
