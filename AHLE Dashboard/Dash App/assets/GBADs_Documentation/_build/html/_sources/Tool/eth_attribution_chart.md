<p>
Important note: attribution is estimated for species groups rather than for individual species.
</p>
<p>
The controls for the attribution chart allow the user to select up to 5 variables to display the results sliced by lower levels of aggregation. The available variables are:
<ul>
	<li>Cause: infectious, non-infectious, or external</li>
	<li>AHLE Component: Mortality, Production Loss, or Health Costs. NOTE: Health Costs make up the smallest proportion of AHLE and may not be visible in the chart.</li>
	<li>Production System</li>
	<li>Age Group</li>
	<li>Sex</li>
</ul>
All grouping variables except for the first can also be set to None.
