<b>Notes</b>
- If multiple performance targets were supplied, the "as hatched" performance was used.
- We applied the same breed standard to all broilers in each country. This is a more reasonable assumption for some countries than others. In China for example, a significant proportion of broiler production uses domestic "yellow-feather" breeds which do not have the same performance as the white-feather breeds represented here (source: https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Poultry%20and%20Products%20Annual_Beijing_China%20-%20Peoples%20Republic%20of_08-01-2020). We suggest setting the Achievable % of breed standard to less than 100% to account for this.
